# OpenBank

OpenBank is a Laravel based web application that you can use to keep track of your BitCoin public keys, your total balance and so forth.
All the data is collected in realtime and will be shown to you on its web interface.

### Screenshot

This is a screenshot of my instance running on a Raspberry Pi.

### Safe

The database only stores the password you're using to access your OpenBank instance and your public keys, **no sensitive data will be leaked even if compromised**.
Moreover if you install it on a Raspberry Pi running on your home network, you won't leak your ip address to a third entity.

###Â Crontab

To install the needed cronjob:

    */1 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/openbank/www/artisan schedule:run
